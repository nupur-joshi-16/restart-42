# 6. Printing to the Console in Python

### print("Hello world")
This is the basic Python command to display text on the screen.
It prints the message **Hello world** in the console.

### `print` function?
The **print() function** is used to output text, numbers, or variables to the screen.
Example: `print("Welcome")`

### Double quotes?
Double quotes `" "` are used to create **string literals** in Python.
You can write strings in double quotes or single quotes. Both work.
Example: `"Hello"` and `'Hello'` are the same.

### What is a String?
A **string** is a sequence of characters (letters, numbers, symbols) enclosed in quotes.
Example: `"Python"`, `"123"`, `"Hello!"`

### What is a Syntax Error?
A **syntax error** happens when Python cannot understand your code because the rules are broken.
Example:
`print("Hello"` → Missing closing bracket → Syntax Error

### StackOverflow website
**StackOverflow** is a question-and-answer website where programmers ask coding questions and get solutions from other developers. It’s a helpful resource for debugging and learning.

### What is PEP8?
**PEP 8** is the official **style guide for Python code**.
It tells you how to write clean, readable, and standard Python code (naming conventions, spacing, indentation, etc.).

### Add new line at the end of the Python file (PEP 8 Rule)
According to **PEP 8** (Python style guide), every Python file **must end with one blank newline**.
This helps tools like Git and linters work correctly.
You do **not** add this with `print()` — it is simply a newline at the end of the file, automatically added by most editors (including PyCharm).

### Run the code in PyCharm
To run your Python file:

* Click on the **Run** button
* OR press the shortcut key: **Shift + F10** (Linux PyCharm)
