# String Manipulation

String manipulation means performing operations on strings such as slicing, joining, replacing, splitting, or changing case.
Examples:

* `"hello".upper()` → `HELLO`
* `"Python"[0:3]` → `Pyt`
* `"a,b,c".split(",")` → `['a', 'b', 'c']`

### \n → New line

`\n` is an escape character used to insert a new line inside a string.
Example:
`print("Hello\nWorld")`
Output:
Hello
World

### Concatenation string

String concatenation means **joining two or more strings together** using the `+` operator.
Example:
`"Hello" + " " + "World"` → `"Hello World"`

### Indentation error

Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code.
If indentation is missing or inconsistent, Python shows an **IndentationError**.
Example:

```
if True:
print("Hi")   # Wrong indentation → Error
```

### Debug the code

Debugging means finding and fixing errors in your program.
In PyCharm, the debugger allows you to:

* Set breakpoints
* Execute code step-by-step
* Inspect variable values
* Understand the flow of execution

### Bug (moth) story?

The famous “bug” story comes from **1947**.
Grace Hopper and her team found a **real moth** stuck inside the Mark II computer, causing a malfunction.
They taped the moth in the logbook and wrote:
**“First actual case of bug being found.”**
This made the terms **bug** (error) and **debugging** (fixing errors) popular in computing.
