### The Python `input` Function

The `input()` function **pauses program execution** and waits for the user to type text and press Enter. It returns the typed text **as a string**.
Example: `name = input("What is your name? ")`
After running, the console shows the prompt `What is your name? ` and whatever the user types is stored in `name`.

Notes:

* `input()` always returns a **string**. To get numbers, convert the returned value: `age = int(input("Age: "))` or `price = float(input("Price: "))`.
* Use `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing whitespace: `s = input("Enter: ").strip()`.
* `input()` is a blocking call — the program waits until the user presses Enter.

### Example

```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name)
```

### Thonny (thonny.org) — debugger and step-by-step execution

Thonny is a beginner-friendly Python IDE (available at thonny.org). Key features useful for learning and debugging:

* Simple interface ideal for beginners.
* Line-by-line (step) execution so you can watch how variables change.
* Built-in debugger with breakpoints and variable view.
* Shows function calls and call stack clearly.
* Good for teaching and understanding program flow before moving to heavier IDEs like PyCharm.

### Comment?

Comments are lines in code ignored by Python — used to explain or annotate code.

* Single-line comments use `#`:

  ```
  # This is a comment
  x = 5  # comment after code
  ```
* Multi-line comments / docstrings use triple quotes (commonly used for documentation strings in functions/classes):

  ```
  """
  This is a multi-line string.
  It can be used as a comment or docstring.
  """
  def f():
      """This is a function docstring."""
      pass
  ```

Best practices:

* Write short, clear comments for non-obvious code.
* Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
* Use docstrings to document what functions/classes do (useful for `help()` and auto-documentation).
