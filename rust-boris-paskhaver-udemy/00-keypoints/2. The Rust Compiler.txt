2. The Rust Compiler

Source Code
• Source code is the code that developers write.
• Source code is meant to be readable by humans.
• The computer cannot understand the Rust code itself.

The Rust Compiler
• The Rust compiler is a program that translates our source code into an executable program.
• The executable program is called a binary or binary executable.
• The computer can understand and execute the instructions in the binary.
• Think of the compiler like a translator.

Syntax
• Syntax describes the characters/symbols that developers use to write source code.
• Programming languages are strict. Rust is among the strictest of them all. Every detail matters to the compiler.
• Case sensitivity matters. A capital letter is not equal to a lowercase letter.
• Spaces matter. One space is not equal to two spaces or no spaces.
• Symbols matter. A semicolon is not equal to a comma.
• Line breaks matter.
