1. Intro to Rust

What is Rust?
• Rust is a system programming language.
• System programming refers a category of languages that are optimized for situations where resources (memory and CPU) are limited.
• Rust was developed by Graydon Hoare while working at Mozilla. It made its public debut in 2010.
• Rust can be setup on all modern operating systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux).

What can Rust build?
• Command line programs (CLIs)
• Build tools
• Device drivers
• Databases
• Programming languages
• Web applications
• Operating systems

Who uses Rust?
• Amazon Web Services (AWS)
• Microsoft
• Firefox web browser
• Discord

Why learn Rust?
• Build safe, fast, and efficient programs
• Understand new patterns of program design.
• Master a language skyrocketing in popularity.
• High Professional Value: Rust's compile-time safety eliminates entire classes of bugs (like $\text{memory leaks}$ and $\text{data races}$) that cost large corporations millions, making Rust developers critical and highly paid resources.

Some Fun Tidbits
• StackOverflow's annual developer survey ranked Rust as the most loved developer language for 8 years straight.
• Twitter's/Square's Jack Dorsey called Rust "a perfect programming language".
• Rust developers are called Rustaceans (like "crustaceans").
