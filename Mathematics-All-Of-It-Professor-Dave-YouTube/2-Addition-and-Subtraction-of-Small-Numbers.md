# 2. Addition and Subtraction of Small Numbers

**I. THE ORIGINS OF ARITHMETIC**

* **Math started as language:** Before it was a school subject, math was a set of symbols and models used to communicate ideas like, "How many people are in the tribe?" or "How many apples are in this basket?"
* **The Power of Ten:** We use a system based on the number **10** primarily because humans have ten fingers. If we had eight fingers, our entire counting system would likely be different.
* **Counting vs. Calculating:** While counting is just looking at a pile of items, calculating is using rules and symbols to find an answer without needing to see the objects in front of you.

**II. ADDITION: COMBINING NUMBERS**

* **Definition:** Addition is combining two numbers into one single number, called a **sum**.
* **The Equation:** In the expression $2 + 3 = 5$:
    * The **plus symbol (+)** acts like the word "and."
    * The **equals sign (=)** acts like the word "is."
    * The total (**5**) is the **sum**.
* **Property - Commutative:** The order doesn't matter. $2 + 3$ is the same as $3 + 2$.
* **Property - Associative:** When adding three or more numbers, it doesn't matter which pair you add first. $(2 + 3) + 4$ gives the same result as $2 + (3 + 4)$.

**III. SUBTRACTION: FINDING THE DIFFERENCE**

* **Definition:** Subtraction is the opposite (inverse) of addition. It finds the **difference** between numbers.
* **The Equation:** In the expression $5 - 1 = 4$:
    * The **minus symbol (-)** acts like the phrase "less" or "taken away."
    * The result (**4**) is the **difference**.
* **Visualizing Subtraction:** Think of it as the distance on a number line. For $14 - 11$, the difference is **3** because it takes 3 "steps" to get from 11 to 14.
* **Why it's different from Addition:**
    * **Not Commutative:** The order **does** matter. $3 - 2$ is not the same as $2 - 3$.
    * **Not Associative:** The order in which you perform multiple subtractions changes the final answer.

**IV. CONNECTING SYMBOLS TO REALITY**

* **Concrete Meaning:** Even complicated symbols (like square roots or integrals) that look scary are just tools rooted in the physical world, just like the plus and minus signs. 
* **Understanding vs. Memorizing:** Once you understand what a symbol represents in real life, it stops being frustrating and becomes a useful tool.

### **ALWAYS REMEMBER**

* **Order matters in subtraction:** You can add numbers in any order ($2 + 3$ is the same as $3 + 2$), but you cannot subtract them in any order ($5 - 2$ is **not** the same as $2 - 5$).
* **The Number Line:** Think of subtraction as the "distance" between two points. $10 - 7$ is just asking, "How far is it from 7 to 10?"
* **Math symbols represent reality:** Every symbol you see, no matter how scary it looks, is just a shortcut for a real-world action or object.
