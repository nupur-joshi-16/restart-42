# 1. Introduction to Mathematics

**I. WHAT IS MATH AND WHY DOES IT MATTER?**

* **It is everywhere:** Math is the "engine" behind our phone, how planes stay in the air, and how social media works. 
* **It is the language of the universe:** Everything from tiny atoms to giant galaxies follows mathematical rules.
* **It is "true" regardless of humans:** Even if humans didn't exist, one plus one would still equal two. Math is a set of facts built into reality.

**II. MATH VS. OTHER SUBJECTS**

* **Definite answers:** Math is the study of questions that have a single, perfect answer.
* **Opinion vs. Fact:** Unlike politics or food (where "the best" is an opinion), math doesn't have "points of view." You are either right or you are wrong.
* **Math vs. Science:** Science tests things over and over to see if they are likely true, but math can prove things are 100% true forever.

**III. HOW MATH GROWS**

* **Humans create math:** We didn't find math in a book; we created the tools and symbols to solve problems.
* **Asking questions:** Mathematicians spend their time asking questions and then building the "tools" (formulas and logic) to find the answer.
* **Surprising discoveries:** Sometimes math shows us things we can't see, like the idea that there are different types of "infinity."

**IV. WHAT THIS COURSE COVERS**

* **The Journey:** Starts with very easy counting and adding (the basics of civilization).
* **The Goal:** It will move through high school math and up to college-level concepts.
* **Who it is for:** Anyone who wants to understand physics/chemistry, students who need help in class, or people who just want to do daily math better.
