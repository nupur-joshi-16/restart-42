005 - Section Intro

006 - Hello World!
      |-> Chrome Developer Tools
          |-> ctrl + shift + j
          |-> Right click > Inspect
          |-> Click the three-dot menu (⋮) > More Tools → Developer Tools > Console Tab
      |-> alert("Hello World!");
               |->  let js = 'amazing';
      |-> if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!');
      |-> js = 'boring';
               |->  if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is FUN!'); // alert window not showing because of js is now boring.
      |-> In console > up arrow - previous commands one by one
      |-> We can do simle math operations
          |-> 40 + 8 + 23 - 10; // 61
      
007 - A Brief Introduction to JavaScript
      |-> What is JavaScript?
          |-> JavaScript is a high-level, oject-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
              |-> Programming language?
                  |-> Instruct computer to do things.
              |-> High-level programming language?
                  |-> We don't have to worry about complex stuff like memory management.
                      |-> What is memory management? - need to explore
              |-> Oject-oriented?
                  |-> Based on objects, for storing most kinds of data.
              |-> Multi-paradigm?
                  |-> We can use different styles of programming
     |-> The role of JavaScript in Web Development
         |-> Three technologies of web development - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
             |-> HTML > Content > Noun
             |-> CSS > Presentation of content > Adjectives
             |-> JavaScript > programming Language > verbs
                 |-> Building web applications, Dynamic and interactive effects, Maniupulate data etc.
     |-> There is nothing you cant do with JavaScript (Well. Almost...)
         |-> Fronend Applications - Dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
             |-> JavaScript libraries/frameworks > React, Angular, Vue
                 |-> 100% based on JavaScript. They might go away, but JavaScript won't
             |-> Backend Applications - Web Applications on web servers
                 |-> NodeJs
             |-> Native Mobile Applications
                 |-> Ionic, React Native
             |-> Native Desktop Applications
                 |-> Electron
      |-> JavaScript releases...(More about this later)
          |-> ES5 > ES6 / ES2015 > ES7 / ES2017 and so on...(Yearly new release)
              |-> ES stands foe EcmaScript

008 - Linking a JavaScript File
      |-> script tag in html file (inside / inline script)
          |-> <script>
                                       let js = 'amazing';
                                       if (js == 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is fun!');

                                       console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
                                   </script>
      |-> External js (seperate js file)
          |-> linking js file
              |-> <script src="script.js"></script>
                  |-> Usually write at the end of body tag
                

009 - Values and Variables
      |-> What is variable?
      |-> Declairing a variable
          |-> let firstName = "Nupur";
               |->  console.log(firstName);
               |->  Variable Naming convention
      |-> Syntax Error
      |-> Reserved Javascript Keywords
      |-> 'name' keyword we can use (not giving error but its illigal) but its reserved keyword.
      |-> We should not start variable name with uppercase. Its not illigal but convention.
      |-> constant value in uppercase
          |-> let PI = 3.1415; //convention not rule
      |-> Variable names should be discriptive
