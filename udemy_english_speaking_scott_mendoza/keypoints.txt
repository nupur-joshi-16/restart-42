009 - The parts of an English sentence - English Grammar
      |-> The subject and predicate : A complete thought
      |-> In English every sentence needs two parts
          |-> The Subject and predicate
      |-> The dog runs down the street
          |-> The dog - Subject
          |-> runs down the street - predicate
      |-> without these two parts, the sentence is not complete thought.
      |-> They must be in this order as well
      |-> Subject first followed by the predicate
      | The subject : The naming part
          |-> The subject of a sentence is who or what the sentence is about.
          |-> The subject is a noun.
          |-> A noun is any person place or thing.
          |-> 'The dog' is the subject.
          |-> This is what the sentence is about.
      |-> The predicate : The telling part
          |-> The predicate of a sentence tells what the subject is doing.
          |-> It will start with a verb and contain the object (a noun).
          |-> runs down the street
              |-> Verb + Object
          |-> 'runs down the street' is the predicate.
          |-> this tells us what the dog (subject) is doing.
      |-> The basic sentence: Subject + Verb + Object
          |-> Now we can build basic English sentence.
          |-> Knowing only the rules about the subject and predicate.
          |-> A basic English sentence is
              |-> Subject + Predicate (Verb + object)
              |-> The dog runs down the street.
                  |-> The dog - Subject
                  |-> runs down the street - Verb + Object
