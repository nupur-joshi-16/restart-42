1 - Present Simple Tense
-------------------------

What are tenses?
Tenses are simply the way we talk about time in English.

Present Simple --> General permanent

When we talk about something that's true in general, that's present simple.
Also, present simple is for more or less permanent.
For example, if you have a job, off course, no job or thing in life is necessarily permanent.
What does permanent mean, that it lasts all the time, but let's say you're not changing job every day.
So, more or less, this is the job you'll always have.
For those kind of activities, we use present simple,
I work at the bank.
I work in the store.

Subject   Verb
---------------------------------
I         work   -->    I work.
You       work   -->    You work.
We        work   -->    We work.
They      work   -->    They work.
He        works  -->    He works.
She       works  -->    She works.
It        works  -->    It works.


We have five different situations in which we can use this tense.
1. Permanent
2. Routines
3. Facts
4. Schedules
5. Frequency

1. permanent
• We live in New York.
• He works at a bank.

2. Routines
• I wake up at 6:00
• I go to sleep at 11:00

3. Facts
• The sun rises in the east.

4. Schedules
• Our class starts at 9:00
• The flight leaves at noon.

5. Frequency
• She always takes the bus.


There are some words in English, and they're called adverbs of frequency, to describe how often something is happening.
And these words are:
• never --> 0%
• rarely --> 10-20%
• sometimes --> 50%
• often --> 75%
• always --> 100%


How to form 'Present Simple Tense'

Positive         Negative            Question          Question Word
------------------------------------------------------------------------
• I work.        I don't work.       Do I Work?        Where do I work?
• You work.      You don't work      Do you work?      Where do you work?
• We work.       We don't work.      Do we work?       Where do we work?
• They work.     They don't work     Do they work?     Where do they work?

• He works       He doesn't work     Does he work?     Where does he work?
• She works.     She doesn't work.   Does she work?    Where does she work?
• It works.      It doesn't work.    Does it work?     Where does it work?

Note: He, She and It --> We need to add 's' in positive sentence after verb.

Now, another important point is that sometimes, when we ask questions, we don't just start "do" or "does".
But we need to add a question word.

Question words
• Where
• What
• Who
• When
• Why
• Have
• How much
• How many
• How often
and so on...
