# 1.2 Evolution of Computers

- Historical Context: In ancient times, people used various devices and methods for calculations that were not very fast or accurate, which eventually led to the invention of the computer.

- Development Path: The computer has progressed through several phases of technological development to produce accurate results at a very fast speed.

- Pre-Invention Methods:

    - People initially performed simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction) on their fingers.

    - Later, stones were used to represent numbers and carry out simple calculations.

    - Other devices included notches in sticks, knots in ropes, etc., for carrying out calculations.

- Automation: Early computing devices were manually operated, while later devices became completely automated.

## 1.2.1 Manual Computing Devices

### The Sand Table:

- **Concept:** The first known device to arrange stones for simple calculations in the sand.

- **Structure:** A device with stones arranged in three distinct channels in the sand.

- **Capacity:** Each channel had a maximum capacity of 10 stones.

- **Addition Operation:** Performed by incrementing the count of the right-hand channel. When the right-hand channel reached maximum capacity, the stones were removed, and one stone was added to the next (left-hand) channel (similar to a carry operation).

### The Abacus

- **Predecessor to Sand Table:** The invention of the sand table led to the development of a fast calculating device known as the abacus.

- **Structure:** The sand table was replaced by the abacus, which used a wooden frame with grooves, wires, and stones/beads.

- **Usage:** Abacus is still in use in many parts of the world. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations by sliding the beads on the wires.

### Napier's Bones

- **Inventor and Date:** Another complicated manual device developed by John Napier in the year 1614.

- **Purpose:** Specifically designed for the multiplication and quotient (division) of numbers.

- **Structure:** Consisted of a board where nine squares were used to hold the numbers from 1 to 9. It also included 10 rods made up of strips of ivory bones.

- **Method:** Multiplication of two numbers with Napier Bones could be performed faster and involved the multiplication of only a single digit at a time. (Figure 1.4 shows the process).

### Slide Rule

- **Inventor:** The idea of using bones to carry out multiplication was modified by Edmund Gunter in 1620 to produce the slide rule.

- **Function:** This device consisted of two sets of graduated scales, which could slide over each other.

- **Purpose:** Used for performing multiplication and division, as well as complex scientific functions like logarithms, trigonometry, and finding roots.

### Pascaline (Arithmetic Machine)

- **Inventor and Date:** Developed by Blaise Pascal in 1642.

- **Description:** Also known as a numerical wheel calculator. It was a container device with a set of toothed wheels that could be operated by hand.

- **Function:** Could handle numbers up to 9,999,999.

- **Evolution:** Pascaline was further improved by German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz to produce a device called the stepped reckoner, which was able to perform multiplication and division, as well as the calculation of square roots.

## 1.2.2 Automated Computing Devices

- **Charles Babbage:** An English mathematician, often called the "father of modern computer."

- **Difference Engine (1822):** Designed to automate the repeated series of steps needed in tabulating various functions (like polynomial, logarithmic, and trigonometric). It was a mechanical computing machine.

- **Analytical Engine (1833):** The general-purpose programmable digital computer. It was the first device that used all the features of a modern digital computer, including an input unit, an output unit, a storage unit, a processor, and a control unit.

- **Input:** The input was a program (set of instructions) and a set of data.

### Early Electric Computers

- **MARK I**

    - **Inventor and Date:** Howard Aiken designed MARK I in 1937 for an American mathematician.

    - **Completion:** Completed in 1944.

    - **Performance:** It was one of the well-known early computers that could perform the multiplication of two numbers with twenty figures in just 6 seconds.

    - **Drawback:** It was noisy and large in size.

- **Colossus**

    - **Inventor and Date:** Developed by Alan Mathison (Turing) in 1944 for the British mathematician's team.

    - **Purpose:** A special purpose electronic programmable computer designed to perform device that used the vacuum tube technology in performing different operations.

    - **Function:** It was designed to perform only some specific functions.


- **ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator)**

    - **Type:** General-purpose electronic digital computer.

    - **Developers & Date:** Developed by John Eckert and John Mauchly at the Moore School of Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania in 1946.

    - **Technology:** Used vacuum tube technology in its basic circuits.

    - **Capabilities:** A general-purpose computer capable of solving all types of computing problems.

    - **Internal Hardware:** Included 17,468 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, 70,000 registers, 7,200 crystal diodes, and 10,000 capacitors.

    - **Performance:** A bulky computer that operated at 1,000 times more speed than MARK I.

    - **Function:** Designed to perform simple arithmetic operations as well as advanced operations (e.g., separating the sign of a number and comparing numbers to check for equality).

    - **Number System:** Used the decimal number system for representing and processing values.

- **EDVAC (Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer)**

    - **Date:** Introduced in 1949.

    - **Number System:** Used the binary number system for representing and processing values.

    - **Developers:** Also invented by John Eckert and John Mauchly.

    - **Successor:** Considered the successor of ENIAC.

    - **Principle:** The first computer that worked on the principle of stored program.

    - **Stored Program Concept:** The stored program considers the programs and data stored in the memory as a string of binary numbers. Therefore, programs and data stored in the memory are indistinguishable as inputs for the computer.

    - **Hardware Components:** Included magnetic tape, control unit, dispatcher unit, processor, timer, dual memory, and three temporary tanks to hold a single word.

- **EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator)**

    - **Developers & Date:** Another early British electronic computer developed by Maurice Wilkes and his team at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1949.

    - **Technology:** Used vacuum tube technology and mercury delay lines for constructing the memory of the computer.

    - **Input/Output:** Typical input and output unit was the punch card and teleprinter, respectively.

    - **Performance:** Only able to carry out 650 instructions per second. Not considered a fast computing device.

- **UNIVAC (Universal Automatic Computer)**

    - **Developers & Date:** Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation, formed by John Eckert and John Mauchly, made serious efforts in automated computing. The company invented UNIVAC in 1951.

    - **Type:** The first bulky commercial computer.

    - **Technology:** Used 5,200 vacuum tubes for constructing the basic logic circuits.

    - **Memory:** Mercury delay lines were used to construct the memory for storing data and programs.

    - **Unique Feature:** Provided separate processors for handling input/output and processing functions, making it unique among early computers.
