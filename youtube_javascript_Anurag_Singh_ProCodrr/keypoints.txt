Video 6 : History of JavaScript
===================================

Netscape
A web browser which used to dominate the world in 90s with the market share of around 90%.
This is where the story of JavaScript starts from.

Static Website
Website used to be static then. And browsers could not do even a single calculations at that time.
In order to do even a simple math browsers had to servers.

Comparison of these two website

chrome > inspect > dev tools > Network > Offline

Making the language of web
So the founder of Netscape decided to develope a programming language for his Netscape.

Founder of Netscape : Marc Andreessen


Which was the first browser for public use and who developed it?
The first web browser for public use was Mosaic, developed in 1993 by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), University of Illinois.
ðŸ‘‰ While WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus) by Tim Berners-Lee was the very first browser (1990), it was limited and not widely available to the general public. Mosaic is considered the first popular/public browser that brought the web to mainstream users.


Making the language of web
In september 1995 Andreessen hired one guy called Brendan Eich to develope that language.

Creator of Javascript - Brendan Eich

Development of JavaScript
Brendan starts the development and the rest is history. He developed the whole new language in just 10 freaking days.
And that language was called "Mocha". Then is was changed to 'LiveScript' and then finally 'JavaScript'.

This is how the language of internet is born - JavaScript.

Microsoft --> internet explorer --> JScript


ECMA International
European Computer Manufacturers Association

Every year new release or feature.
i.e.
ES6 ES2015 June 2015
ES7 ES2016 June 2016
and so on...

Google Chrome - 2008 - JavaScript 'V8 engine'
Firefox - SpiderMonkey

Ryan Dahl - Creator of NodeJS

Is JavaScript Interprited or compiled language?
ChatGPT said:

JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, but in modern engines itâ€™s more accurate to say it is interpreted + Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled.

Interpreted: Original JavaScript engines (like in early browsers) directly read and executed the code line by line.

JIT Compiled: Modern engines (like Googleâ€™s V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra) first parse and interpret the code, then compile hot code paths into optimized machine code at runtime for better performance.

ðŸ‘‰ So, the precise answer: JavaScript is an interpreted language with JIT compilation


Wht is interpreted?
What is compiled?

chrome engine - jit compiler

What is binary?

extrnal Javascript file link in html file 
<script src="script.js"></script>
<script src="name-2.js"></script>

inline js
internal js

script tag inside head tag vs end of the body tag. plus and minus points.

console.log("Hello world!");

Console --> REPL
R = Read
E = Eval or Evaluate
P = Print
L = Loop

clear console --> Ctrl + L

VS code extension --> JavaScript (ES6) code snippets
