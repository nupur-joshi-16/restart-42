UNIT - 1 
Present continuous (I am doing)

Nupur is driving a car.

This means: Nupur is driving now. The action is not finished.
Am/is/are -ing is the present continuous:

• I'm driving.
• He's working.
• They're working.

Often the action is happening at the time of speaking:
• Please don't make so much noise. I'm working.
• Where's Margaret? She's having a bath.
• Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more.
• Hello Jane. Are you enjoying the party?
• I'm tired. I'm going to bed now. Goodnight!


But the action is not necessarily happening at the time of speaking.
For Example:
Tom: "I'm reading an interested book at the moment. I'll lend it to you when I've finished it."
Tom is not reading the book at the time of speaking.
He means that he has started it but not finished it yet.
He is in the middle of reading it.

We use the present continuous when we talk about things happening in a period around now
(for example, today / this week / this evening etc.)

• You are working hard today.
• Is Susan working this week?

We use the present continuous when we talk about changes happening around now:
• The population of the world is rising very fast.
• Is your English getting better?
