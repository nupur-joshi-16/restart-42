# 4. Setting Up Our Code Editor

We are going to use **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as our code editor.

We will install the following extension:

- Theme: Monokai Pro

Update the following VS Code settings:

- Set **Auto Save** to `onFocusChange`.
- Set **Multi Cursor Modifier** to `Alt` (or `CtrlCmd` on Mac).
- Turn **Word Wrap** on.
- Enable **Format On Save** by ticking the checkbox.

Make sure that Google Chrome is installed on your system.
