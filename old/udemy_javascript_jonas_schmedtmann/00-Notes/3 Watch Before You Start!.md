# 3. Watch Before You Start!

### Some Quick Considerations Before We Start…

- You need to code along with me! You have to code YOURSELF
- Try all the coding challenges!
- If you want the course material to stick, take notes.
- If this is your first time ever programming, please don’t get overwhelmed.
- In the first sections of the course, don’t bother understanding WHY things work the way they do in JavaScript. Also, don’t stress about efficient code, or fast code, or clean code.
- Before moving on from a section, make sure that you understand exactly what was covered.
- If you have an error or a question, start by trying to solve it yourself! This is essential for your progress. If you can’t solve it, check the Q&A section. What is Codepen?
- Most importantly, have fun!
