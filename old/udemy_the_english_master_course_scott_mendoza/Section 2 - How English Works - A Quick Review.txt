2.9 The Parts of an English Sentence - English Grammar
    |--> Parts of a sentence overview
         |--> Noun
         |--> Adverb
         |--> Verb
         |--> Adjective

    |--> The subject and predicate: A complete thought
         |--> In English, every sentence needs two parts. The subject and the predicate.
              |--> The dog runs down the street.
                   |--> The dog --> Subject
                   |--> runs down the street --> predicate
         |--> Without these two parts, the sentence is not a complete thought. They must be in this order as well.
 
         |--> The Subject: The Naming Part
              |--> The subject of a sentence is who or what the sentence is about.
              |--> The subject is a noun.
              |--> A noun is any person place or thing.
              
              |--> The dog runs down the street.
                   |--> "The dog" is the subject. This is what the sentence is about.

         |--> The Predicate: The Telling Part
              |--> The predicate of a sentence tells what the subject is doing.
              |--> It will start with a verb and contain the object (a noun).
                   |--> The dog runs down the street.
                        |--> runs down the street --> Verb + Object
                        |--> "runs down the street" is the predicate. This tells us what the dog (subject) is doing.

         |--> The Basic Sentence: Subject + Verb + Object
              |--> Now we can build basic English sentences. Knowing only the rules about the subject and predicate.
              |--> A basic English sentence is
                   |--> Subject + Predicate (Verb + Object)
                   |--> The dog runs down the street.
                        |--> The dog --> Subject
                        |--> runs down the street --> Verb + Object
