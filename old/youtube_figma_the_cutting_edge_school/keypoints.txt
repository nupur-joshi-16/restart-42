Video 2: How to use Figma? Frames & Auto-layout
===============================================
1. Groups vs Frames and constraints
2. Using Auto-layout and plugins for practical use
3. Practical Implementation hands on examples

A component is like a parent and instances are children.
In instance you can't change any constraints.
Scale will define the layer's size and position as a percentage of the frame's dimensions. It will then maintain those proportions as you resize it.

Responsive design vs adaptive design

Responsive design
✅ Loads the same website on all device.
✅ It resizes according to the viewport.
✅ No. UI Elements same.
✅ One change reflects everywhere.
✅ Performs better with SEO
❌ You can't have every element on smaller devices.
❌ Takes more time to load since all components are expected to be there.

Adaptive Design
✅ When you can afford to lose some features on mobile.
✅ Most landing pages use Responsive design
✅ Loads faster too because it downloads only the required code.
✅ Understand the difference between Desktop Web App, Mobile Web App, Native Mobile App, Native Desktop App
