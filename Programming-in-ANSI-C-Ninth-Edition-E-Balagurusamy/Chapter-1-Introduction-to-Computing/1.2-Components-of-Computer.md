# 1.2 : Components of a Computer

__Definition:__<br>
A computer is an electronic device designed to perform arithmetic (math) and logical (true/false) operations.

__The Four Major Components:__<br>

1. __Central Processing Unit (CPU):__ The "brain" that executes instructions.

2. __Input Device(s):__ Tools to send data into the computer (e.g., keyboard, mouse).

3. __Output Device(s):__ Tools to display or send data out (e.g., monitor, printer).

4. __Memory:__ Stores data and instructions for the CPU to access.

__Buses:__ <br>
These act as the internal communication highways that allow all these components to interact with one another.

In computer terms, a __bus__ is a physical communication system that acts like a "highway" inside the computer. It consists of electrical wires or conductive traces on the motherboard that allow hardware components like the CPU and memory to send information to each other.

To perform a single task, the computer uses three specialized "lanes" that make up the __System Bus__:

To perform a single task, the computer uses three specialized "lanes" that make up the System Bus:

1. __The Address Bus__
- __Function:__ Tells the computer where the information is going or coming from.

- __Direction:__ __Unidirectional.__ The CPU sends an address (like a house number) to the memory or I/O device.

- __Analogy:__ Writing the destination address on an envelope.

<br>

2. __The Data Bus__

- __Function:__ Carries the actual information (the content) being transferred.

- __Direction:__ __Bidirectional.__ Information flows back and forth between the CPU, memory, and devices.

- __Analogy:__ A two-way road carrying the actual packages between buildings.

<br>

3. __The Control Bus__

- __Function:__ Carries __control signals__ that synchronize everything. It tells a device whether to "Read" or "Write".

- __Direction:__ __Bidirectional__ (Mixed).

- __Analogy:__ A remote control giving commands like "start" or "stop".

```
The term bus in computing is indeed an analogy based on the Latin word omnibus (meaning "for all"), which was first used for public transit vehicles that carried many passengers at once.

Just as a city bus carries a limited number of "passengers" (seats) and follows a schedule to transport people between stops, a computer bus carries a specific number of "bits" (width) and follows an electronic schedule (clock speed) to transport data between hardware components.

```

#### Why the Comparison Works

- __Capacity:__ A city bus with 32 seats transports 32 people at once; a __32-bit bus__ sends 32 bits of data at exactly the same time.

- __Stops:__ Just as people get on or off at different stops (School, Hospital, Home), data gets "picked up" or "dropped off" at different destinations like the CPU, RAM, or a USB port.

-__Fixed Paths:__ A vehicle bus follows a specific road; computer data travels along fixed electrical "tracks" on the motherboard called __traces.__

#### The History of the Name

The term actually entered the computing world through electrical engineering. Engineers used heavy metal bars to carry high-voltage power to all parts of a large machine; they called these __busbars__. When early computers were built with bundles of wires doing the same job for data, the name was shortened to __bus__.



## 1.2.1 Central Processing Unit (CPU)

The CPU is the primary unit where all processing activities occur, serving as the electronic "brain" of the computer.

- __Architecture (VLSI):__ <br>
Modern CPUs consist of very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) electronic circuits containing the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), the Control Unit (CU), and various registers.

- __ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):__<br>
    - Executes arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction) and logical operations (e.g., comparisons of operands).
    - Contains specific circuits like adders and comparators to handle these tasks.

- __CU (Control Unit):__

    - Responsible for generating internal timing and control signals to manage the hardware.

    - Coordinates activities within the CPU and interfaces with external memory and peripherals.

- __Registers:__

    - High-speed storage devices inside the CPU that act as working memory for the ALU.

    - __Special Purpose Registers:__ Hold specific data or instructions.

    - __General Purpose Registers:__ Used for temporary data storage during processing.

- __Cache Memory:__

    - High-speed, on-chip memory units that are faster than main RAM.

    - Used to reduce the time the CPU waits for data from the slower main memory.

#### Internal Communication (The Bus System)

The CPU uses an internal bus to connect its components (ALU, CU, Registers). Interaction with the rest of the system is managed through three specific buses:

- __Address Bus:__ Used by the CPU to locate a specific word in memory.

- __Data Bus:__ Carries the actual data and information between computer components and the peripherals.

- __Control Bus:__ Transmits control signals generated by the CU to manage memory and peripheral activities.

## 1.2.2 Input Devices

- __Purpose:__ These are the components through which users input data and other instructions to the computer.

- __Most Common Choices:__ The keyboard and the mouse are the most popular input devices.

- __Mechanism:__ Most input devices are electro-mechanical, converting mechanical actions into digital information.
    - __Keyboard:__ Entering data by depressing keys.
    - __Mouse:__ Moving across a surface to locate a position.

- __Digitization:__ The process where mechanical action is converted into electronic signals and transmitted to the CPU or memory.

- __Other Examples:__ Scanners, readers, etc..

## 1.2.3 Output Devices

- __Function:__ Output devices are used by the computer to convey computational results, status, or messages back to the user.

- __Most Common Device:__ The __monitor__ is the most widely used output device, primarily for displaying the results of computations and system messages.

- __Other Examples:__ Common output devices include printers, speakers, and plotters.

- __Peripheral Devices:__ Collectively, both input and output devices are referred to as __peripheral devices__.

- __Auxiliary Nature:__ These devices are considered auxiliary because their existence is not strictly mandatory for the computer's core function, unlike the CPU or memory.

- __Connection:__ They are peripheral components that are connected to a computer to be used for interaction.

## 1.2.4 Memory

The memory or storage unit is the component of a computer that serves data storage purposes. These units vary in terms of access speed and volatility.

- __Access Speed:__ The time taken to store or retrieve data from the memory.

- __Volatility:__ The duration or conditions under which data remains stored in the memory, specifically referring to data retention after power is switched off.

#### A. Primary Memory (Main Memory)

Primary memory is designated as "main memory" because the CPU can directly interact with it through the data and address buses. It is divided into two major types:

1. __RAM (Random Access Memory):__

- __Volatile:__ Loses all stored information as soon as the computer's power is switched off.

- __Function:__ Stores instructions and data related to the program currently being executed.

2. ROM (Read Only Memory):

- __Non-Volatile:__ Retains information even after the computer is switched off.

- __Function:__ Read-only memory that does not permit write operations. It houses critical routines like the Bootstrap Loader.

- __Bootstrap Loader:__ A piece of system software stored in ROM responsible for loading the operating system from secondary memory into RAM once power-on self-tests (POST) are conducted.

#### B. Secondary Memory (Auxiliary Memory)

Secondary memory provides a large depository of non-volatile storage space.

- __Characteristics:__

    - Can store information for as long as desired.
    - __Access Time:__ Slower compared to primary memory.
    - __Examples:__ Hard disks, flash drives, etc..
