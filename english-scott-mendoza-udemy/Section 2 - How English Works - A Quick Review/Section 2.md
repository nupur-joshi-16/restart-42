## 9. The Parts of English Sentence

**Parts of Sentence - Overview**

In English, every sentence needs two parts. The subject and the predicate.

| Subject | Predicate |
| ------  | --------- |
| The dog | runs down the street. |
|

Without these two parts, the sentence is not a complete thought. They must be in this order as well.

**The Predicate: The Telling Part**

The predicate of a sentence tells what the subject is doing. It will start with a verb and contain the object (a noun).

| Subject | Predicate (Verb + Object) |
| ------  | --------- |
| The dog | runs down the street. |
|

"runs down the street" is the predicate. This tells us what the dog (subject) is doing.

**The Basic Sentence: Subject + Verb + Object**

Now we can build basic English sentences. Knowing only the rules about the subject and predicate.

A basic English sentence are:

| Subject | Predicate (Verb + Object) |
| ------  | --------- |
| The cat | jumps on the bed. |
| The mouse | eats cheese. |
| The bird | is in the sky. |
| The man | ate pizza. |
| Adam | went to school |
| The bear | slept in the cave. |
|

**Exercise: Correct the sentence.**

Q. Sinking the boat is <br>
A. The boat is sinking. ✔️

Q. Eats mice a snake <br>
A. A snake eats mice. ✔️

Q. Is hot the sun <br>
A. The sun is hot. ✔️

## 10. Nouns

**What is a Noun?**

A noun is a person, place, or thing.<br>
The **dog** runs down the **street**.<br>
Both **dog** and **street** are nouns.

**Noun Categories**
| Person | Place | Thing | Animal | Feeling |
|--------| ----- | ----- | ------ | ------- |

|

**Common, Proper, or Pronoun**
| Common | Proper | Pronouns |
| ------ | ------ | -------- |

**Exercise**
